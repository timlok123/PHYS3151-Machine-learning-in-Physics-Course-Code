# PHYS3151-Machine-learning-in-Physics-Course-Code

## Description

This GitHub Repository is set up to store the course code of PHYS3151 - Machine Learning in Physics at The University of Hong Kong. This course covers both supervised and unsupervised learning including, 

1. Linear regression 
2. Principal component analysis,
3. Support vector machines,
4. Clustering
5. K-Nearest Neighbors
6. Neural Networks and Deep Learning (FNN)

and their applications to real-world and physics problems. 

There are 2 main motivations for me setting to set up this repository 

1. To back up my code for PHYS3151 course work
2. To serve as a benckmark for people to learn machine learning in Python by doing 

Detailed description of the purpose of the code will be explained in the corresponding pdf file.

## How to Install and Run the code

I am using [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to run the jupyter Notebook.  

You can also using uploading the code to Google drive and run it in Google Colab.
